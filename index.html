        <p>
            I grew up in Amherst NY and graduated from Sweet Home High School in 1996. Afterward I attended the University of Buffalo for 2 years.  I have been married for almost 13 years. We have 2 kids, 1 boy 10 years old and 1 girl 8 years old. 
            I have 3 dogs named Hagrid, Capt Jack, and Boomer.

                Over the years we have lived at 8 different duty stations. My favorite duty station was Heidleberg Germany. While over seas I visited Ireland, Italy, France and Austria.  Before having children I worked for the Defense Finance and Account Service and Defense Military Pay Office.

                I enjoy watching football, listening to all kinds of music, cooking, watching movies, playing video games and lots of outdoor activities including walking my dogs and hiking.
